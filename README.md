# File Classifier
File Classifier is a Python script designed to categorize files based on their file extensions. It allows users to specify an absolute path to a directory containing files and then organizes those files into subdirectories based on their file extensions.  

## Features
• File Categorization: Files are categorized based on their file extensions into separate directories.  
• Support for Subdirectorie: Users can choose whether to enter subdirectories and categorize files within them as well.  
• Cross-Platform: The script is designed to work on Windows operating systems. Support for other platforms like macOS and Linux is planned but not yet implemented.  

## Note
• The script currently only supports Windows operating systems. Support for macOS and Linux is planned but not yet implemented.   
• Make sure to provide valid absolute paths for both the source and destination directories.
